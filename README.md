# ToDoApp

I've created a fully-functional ToDo App using Java Swing! Here's what's included:
Features:
Core Functionality:
✅ Add Tasks - Type and press Enter or click "Add Task"
✅ Delete Tasks - Remove tasks with confirmation dialog
✅ Edit Tasks - Modify task descriptions
✅ Mark Complete - Check/uncheck tasks with visual feedback
✅ Task Statistics - See total and completed tasks

UI Components Used:
JFrame - Main window
JPanel - Layout containers
JButton - Add, Edit, Delete buttons
JTextField - Task input field
JCheckBox - Task completion toggle
JLabel - Task text and statistics
JScrollPane - Scrollable task list

Modern Design:
Clean, modern interface with color scheme
Hover effects on buttons
Placeholder text in input field
Visual feedback for completed tasks (strikethrough effect)
Real-time task statistics
Confirmation dialogs for deletions
